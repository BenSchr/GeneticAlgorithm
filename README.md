## Instructions

### Controls

Graphs: 
- **Mode:** You can choose between circle and random points    
- **Points:** Number of points  
- **Redraw:** Refreshs the graphs with new settings  

Basic settings:
- **Population:** Number of members per generation 
- **Elite:** Control the percentage of the fittest members that can reproduce/crossover
- **Mutation:** Chance of a reproduced child getting a mutation. In this case, two random points are swapped
- **Random:** Percentage of population that is fully random each generation

``` 
test
 ```


Run the algorithm: 
- **Start:** Start/Stop the autoplay function. Limits at generation 1000  
- **Step:** Steps one generation forward
